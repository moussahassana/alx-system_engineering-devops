# This script counts the number of valid directories listed in the PATH environment variable.
# It handles cases with consecutive colons (::) which would otherwise be counted as empty directories.

# 1. Print the contents of the PATH variable.
# 2. Use `tr` to replace all colons (':') with newlines ('\n'),
#    placing each directory on its own line.
# 3. Use `grep -v '^$'` to filter out any empty lines, which result from consecutive colons.
# 4. Use `wc -l` to count the remaining lines, giving us the total number of directories.
count=$(echo "$PATH" | tr ':' '\n' | grep -v '^$' | wc -l)

# Print the final count to the console.
echo "Number of directories in PATH: $count"
